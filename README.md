*Skin_Care
**This project is based on a dataset collected using a Python web scraper in March 2023. The dataset includes:
  Details of over 8,000 beauty products from the Sephora online store, such as product and brand names, prices, ingredients, ratings, and other features.
  Over 1 million user reviews across more than 2,000 skincare products, including user appearance data and peer review ratings.
 **The goal of this project was to fine-tune the RoBERTa model on Sephora product reviews in order to gain insights into the diverse sentiments customers express about different skincare products.

*Breast_cancer :
**This project utilizes a dataset collected in 2018, consisting of breast ultrasound images from 600 female patients aged between 25 and 75 years. The dataset includes 780 images in PNG format, each with an average 
  resolution of 500Ã—500 pixels.Ground truth labels are provided alongside the original images.The images are categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant.
 **The goal of this project was to apply deep learning techniques for breast cancer detection. I experimented with models such as ResNet50, VGG19, and custom CNNs for classification.
   Additionally, I employed Attention U-Net for image segmentation and GANs for data augmentation, which helped improve model performance despite the limited dataset size.
